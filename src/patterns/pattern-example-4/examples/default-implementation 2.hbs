layout: layouts/pattern-example
notes: 
 Below you can see an example pattern. 
 
 
 It has custom styles defined by our pattern CSS, and custom interaction
 defined by our pattern JavaScript.


 These patterns will be exported in our toolkit bundles, and can also be used in
 [prototypes](/prototypes/prototype-example/).
